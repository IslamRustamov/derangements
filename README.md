Here you can find derangements. 
First open derangement_html.html, enter the length of derangement (amount of elements) and press Enter.
After that you will see amount of calculated derangements and derangements themselves.
Main idea of algorithm was taken from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Permutations/Derangements (since there is no variant in PHP I decided to make my own version)
